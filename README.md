<h2>KLP_KMEANS</h2>

it is very fast implementation of Kohonen Learning Procedure Kmeans. It requrires relatively less iteration with powerful NUMPY and THEANO versions. For small problems NUMPY version is better then THEANO version, nevertheless THEANO creates significant difference as the problem getting larger. You are also able to utilize GPU with correct configuration of THEANO. Refer to <a href = 'http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html'> http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html </a>

It is all realeased for freewill of use, however it is good to comment for any suggestion, improvement or application.
